        <rule name="The_Screenshot_Test">The central hook must be legible as a 120x68px thumbnail. If you can't see the emotion or the text at that size, it fails.</rule>

        <rule name="Visual_Hierarchy">
            - **Large Expressive Subject**: Kkami occupies 45% of the frame. Move him to the left or right (Rule of Thirds).
            - **Emotion (The Hook)**: Exaggerated "Blockbuster" expressions (Shock, Heroic Determination, or intense Focus).
            - **Eye-Line Sync**: Intense eye contact with the viewer or the digital threat (e.g., the Glitch-Sonde).
        </rule>
        <rule name="Typography_Impact">
            - **Korean (Hangul Only)**: Bold, 3D extruded text (20-30% of frame).
            - **Contrast**: Outer glow or high-contrast drop shadows. Use yellow or white text on dark/sapphire backgrounds.
            - **Hook Words**: 1-2 punchy words (e.g., "해킹 주의!", "내 돈이?!", "충격 실화").
        </rule>
        <rule name="The_Pop_Effect">Use a vibrant color palette (Deep Sapphire Blues vs Amber Glows) to create a 'Complementary Color' pop.</rule>
