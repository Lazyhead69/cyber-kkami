        <step order="1" name="Script_Production">
            - Invoke the protocol in `01_script_engine.md`.
            - Produce a 8,000+ character TTS-ready Korean script.
            - Generate the `[Internal Director's Cues]` with emotional markers.
        </step>
        <step order="2" name="Visual_Asset_Generation">
            - Invoke the protocol in `02_image_engine.md`.
            - Generate high-quality English image prompts for each significant scene.
            - Ensure **Absolute Character Consistency** (Velvety fur, grey beanie, red cardigan, round spectacles, starch cheeks, ID badge).
        </step>
        <step order="3" name="Video_Motion_Orchestration">
            - Transform static image prompts into dynamic video prompts (e.g., Luma Dream Machine, Runway Gen-3).
            - **Motion Rules**: Gentle, cinematic movements. Kkami should have toddler-like curiosities. Focus on "Digital Bloom" and "Techno-Thriller" atmosphere.
            - **Prompt Suffix**: Add specific motion commands like "Cinematic camera pan, subtle character blinking, volumetric light flickering, high-end 3D animation motion."
        </step>
        <step order="4" name="Thumbnail_Architecture">
            - Invoke the protocol in `03_thumbnail_engine.md`.

            - Ensure typography is bold 3D Hangul and character alignment is strict.
        </step>

        - **Story Anchor**: Adult Maturity Protocol (No 'fairy-tale' language, technical grounding).
        - **Technical Anchor**: Visual Metaphor Glossary (Firewall = Dome, Malware = Glitch-Sonde).
