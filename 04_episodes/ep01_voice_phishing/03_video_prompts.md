# [EP01] 🎬 Prompts Vidéo (Motion Orchestrator)

**Core Workflow**: These are instructions to be used with I2V engines (Luma, Runway, Pika).

---

### [Scene 1] The Wisdom (Motion)
**Instruction**: `The camera performs a slow cinematic zoom into Professor Kkami's eyes. Subtle movement of his long white whiskers. The glowing neural networks of fiber cables in the background pulsate with light. Kkami blinks slowly, radiating mentor authority. --motion 4`

### [Scene 2] The Malware Attack (Motion)
**Instruction**: `Extreme tension. The Glitch-Sonde pulsates and lunges slightly toward the camera from the holographic screen. Professor Kkami's ears twitch, and he shifts his digital stylus defensively. Volumetric dust particles flicker in the red static light. Shaky cam effect. --motion 7`

### [Scene 3] The Golden Shield Pulse (Motion)
**Instruction**: `The three massive golden shields rotate slowly around Professor Kkami. He raises his paw, and the shields emit a rhythmic wave of golden light that repels the digital shadows. High cinematic bloom explosion in the center. --motion 3`

### [Scene 4] The Mentor's Farewell (Motion)
**Instruction**: `Professor Kkami nods gently toward the viewer and adjusts his perfectly round spectacles with his small paw. The floating Naver icon has a soft rotating animation. The scene fades gently with a warm, comforting digital bloom. --motion 2`
