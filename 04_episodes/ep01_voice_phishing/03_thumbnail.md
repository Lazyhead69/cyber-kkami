## Layout Instructions (CapCut / Photoshop)
1. **Visual Hierarchy**: Kkami taking up 45-50% of the right side of the screen.
2. **Text Placement**: The text "해킹 주의!" (Warning: Hacking!) placed boldly on the left side.
3. **Contrast Pop**: Increase the saturation of the 'Red Claw' and 'Yellow Text' to contrast against Kkami's black fur and the sapphire background.
4. **Mobile Verification**: Squint test to ensure the text and Kkami's shocked expression are instantly recognizable.
