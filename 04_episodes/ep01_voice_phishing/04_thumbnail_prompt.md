### High-CTR CGI Blockbuster Thumbnail
**Prompt**: 
> `2000s cinematic 3D digital animation, Pixar style, high-quality CGI, volumetric lighting, subtle bloom. Macro shot of Professor Kkami (Velvety pitch-black fur #050505, star-pattern cheeks, tiny pink nose, long white whiskers, charcoal-grey chunky-knit beanie #36454F). He wears perfectly circular silver-rimmed academic spectacles #C0C0C0 and a cozy deep-red cardigan #8B0000. THREE CLASSIC BROWN BUTTONS VERTICALLY ALIGNED ALONG THE CENTER. Blue professional lanyard with 3D ID badge "가미 선생님". His expression is one of BUG-EYED EXTREME SHOCK and WARNING. In his background, a massive glowing holographic smartphone screen shows a red-eyed Glitch-Sonde emerging. Large bold 3D extruded yellow Hangul text "전화 한 통의 함정!" occupying the bottom 25% of the frame with high-contrast shadows. Rule of thirds: Kkami is slightly to the right. --ar 16:9 --v 6.0`
